## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- TensorFlow C API
- C++ compiler
- Jupyter Notebook (for `.ipynb` files)

### Installation
Follow the instructions in `install_tensorflow_c_api.md` to set up the TensorFlow C API on your machine.

### Running the Examples
- To test your TensorFlow setup, compile and run `hello_tf.c`.
- For inference examples, see `inference_frozen_model.cpp`.
- The Jupyter notebooks (`build_linear_regression.ipynb`, `the_model.ipynb`) provide interactive examples of model building and training.

## Tutorials
- **macOS Users**: Check out `tutorial_macOS.md` for a step-by-step guide to setting up your environment.
- **Windows Users**: `tutorial_windows.md` offers detailed instructions for Windows setup.
